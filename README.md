## Overview

**FaithAgent** is an experimental reinforcement learning environment that models the behavior of a spiritually conscious agent in a simulated daily routine. Unlike typical AI agents that optimize for utility or task performance, FaithAgent optimizes for **Islamic ethical reward (thawab)**, validated by both general Islamic rules and **seerah-based** historical references.

This project is a step toward building culturally sensitive, value-aligned agents using symbolic reward systems and agent simulation frameworks.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Contextual Decision-Making:** The agent selects actions based on time-sensitive contexts such as `"fajr_on_time"` or `"sickness"`.
- **Islamic Reward System:** Actions are scored with spiritually grounded reward values (e.g. praying during war yields more reward than skipping prayer).
- **Seerah-Based Validation:** Decisions are validated against recorded incidents from the life of the Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫.
- **Stochastic Context Generation:** Realistic variations (like war or illness) are introduced using probability to simulate uncertainty.
- **Visualization:** Built-in charts show thawab progression and action distributions across the day.

---

## Features

- Rule-based Islamic action validation (e.g. pray at fajr time = valid)
- Seerah database for historically grounded validation
- Enhanced priority system for actions in life contexts (war, sickness, rain, etc.)
- Time-aware and probabilistically varying environments
- Graphical summary of rewards and behavior
- Final performance report with seerah compliance

---

## Sample Scenarios Simulated

- *‚ÄúShould I pray during a battle?‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúWhat is the best time to recite Surah Mulk if I work through the night?‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm sick, what action has the highest spiritual reward?‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúHow should I structure my day to maximize Islamic values?‚Äù*

---

## Visualization Example

- **Thawab Trend:** Hourly reward progression  
- **Action Distribution:** Frequency of actions like `pray`, `recite_quran`, `work`

## üßæ Sample Output

```text
03:30 | Action: pray             | Context: fajr_on_time | Reward: +10 | Valid: True (Basic Islamic Rule)
09:00 | Action: work             | Context: halal         | Reward: +2  | Valid: True (Basic Islamic Rule)
21:00 | Action: recite_quran     | Context: night         | Reward: +5  | Valid: True (Hadith: Surah Mulk protects from grave punishment)
```

## Academic Motivation

This simulation is part of a broader research direction in value-aligned AI, particularly for applications where faith, ethics, and cultural norms play a critical role in autonomous agent behavior.

## Inspired by:

iStar-RL: Goal-oriented and uncertainty-aware RL environments  
AI Ethics & Autonomy: Agents operating under moral/spiritual constraints  
Symbolic Reasoning: Embedding Islamic rulings and seerah as symbolic rules


## Seerah Database Structure
```
{
  "pray_during_war": {
    "action": "pray",
    "context": "during_war",
    "reward": 20,
    "source": "Battle of Khandaq: Prophet Ô∑∫ prayed under attack"
  },
  "recite_mulk_night": {
    "action": "recite_quran",
    "context": "night",
    "reward": 5,
    "source": "Hadith: Surah Mulk protects from grave punishment"
  }
}
```

## Future Work

 Integrate NLP for contextual awareness (e.g. user asks questions)  
 Expand seerah stories using a knowledge graph  
 Connect to fatwa engines or Islamic rule ontologies  
 Adopt iStar-RL or BDI agent modeling frameworks  
 Introduce internal states (e.g. tiredness, sincerity)
